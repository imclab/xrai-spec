# XRAI runtime adapters

One XRAI document. Many renderers. Each adapter ingests the same v1.0 JSON and produces engine-native scene.

## Current / planned

| Engine | Directory | Status | Target |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Three.js** | `threejs/` | ⏳ stub | **Week 2** (primary web demo, simplest to validate spec) |
| **PlayCanvas** | `playcanvas/` | ⏳ stub | Week 2 (shares JS ecosystem w/ Three.js) |
| **Unity** | `unity/` | ✅ reference in Portals app, standalone extraction Week 3 | Week 3 |
| **WebXR** | `webxr/` | ⏳ stub (thin glue over Three.js) | Week 3 |
| **Unreal** | `unreal/` | ⏳ stub | Month 2 |
| **visionOS RealityKit** | `visionos/` | ⏳ stub | Month 2 |
| **Godot** | `godot/` (not yet) | — | Community-welcomed |
| **Bevy** | `bevy/` (not yet) | — | Community-welcomed |

## Normative contract (every runtime MUST implement)

```
parse(doc: string | object) -> XraiGraph | ParseError
  // Validate against v1.0 schema. Throw or return structured error. Never silently corrupt.

buildScene(graph: XraiGraph) -> EngineNativeScene
  // Entities + relations + transforms applied. Returns engine's scene root type.

(optional) mergeInto(existingScene, graph: XraiGraph) -> EngineNativeScene
  // Apply changeset to existing scene. Idempotent by entity id.
```

## Conformance tests (shared across all runtimes)

A conformance-test corpus lives at `runtimes/_conformance/` (planned):
- Each test = `{input.xrai.json, expected_scene_description.yaml}`
- Every runtime's CI runs the corpus
- Runtime passes if scene description matches expected (within tolerance)

This guarantees XRAI documents are truly portable across engines.

## How to contribute a new runtime

1. Read [`../SPEC.md`](../SPEC.md) v1.0
2. Copy a stub directory (e.g., `threejs/`) as starting point
3. Implement `parse()` + `buildScene()`
4. Run conformance tests
5. PR with runtime + sample project + MIT license
6. BDFL-merged (Year 1); community-merged (Year 2+)

## Handedness / unit conventions (MUST read before implementing)

XRAI canonical convention:
- **Meters** (not cm, not inches)
- **Left-handed Y-up** (Unity native — arbitrary but fixed)
- **Rotations as quaternions** `[x, y, z, w]` (not Euler)

Your engine's native convention may differ. **Convert once in `parse()`**, not scattered through the builder. Detect via `graph.origin.handedness` hint; default to left-handed Y-up.

Examples:
- Three.js / PlayCanvas / RealityKit / Godot: right-handed Y-up → negate z on ingest
- Unreal: left-handed Z-up + centimeters → swap Y↔Z + multiply 100
- Bevy: right-handed Y-up, meters → negate z
