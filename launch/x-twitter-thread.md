# X / Twitter — Launch Thread

**Post timing:** Same day as HN submission, ~30 min after HN goes up. Pinned.
**Format:** 8–10 tweets. First tweet carries the hook. No threadbait ("🧵"). No emoji spam.

## 1 / hook

XRAI — X-ray vision. God's-eye view. Infinite zoom. For everyone.

Open spatial graph format. Voice your world into being. See through AI opacity. See over topology. See across time, possibilities, minds.

MIT forever. No CLA. No gatekeeping. Shipping on iPhone today, 60 FPS.

## 2 / why this format exists

Every major AI lab is racing toward physical-world AI. None of them have agreed on how agents describe and share 3D/4D scenes.

Without an open format, whoever ships first captures the slot. Like USDZ did for Apple.

## 3 / the 80-year version

Bush (memex). Nelson (Xanadu). Berners-Lee (WWW + Giant Global Graph). Hofstadter (analogy). All hit the same wall:

structured cognition needs structured authoring,
and humans won't pay that cost.

LLMs just dropped that cost to zero.

## 4 / what XRAI is

A format for typed hypergraphs of:
- entities (cube, sphere, glb, hologram, light, emitter)
- relationships (parent-of, wire-binds, reacts-to-audio, tracks)
- events (triggers, reactions — v1.1)
- intentions (authored or inferred)

anchored in space + time. Renderable in any engine.

## 5 / what makes it tractable

Any LLM can author XRAI from natural language.

"put a glowing blue sphere above a gold cube"
→ 8 lines of valid XRAI
→ rendered in Unity / Three.js / visionOS

The authoring burden that killed Xanadu is gone.

## 6 / not a replacement

XRAI composes with glTF, USD, USDZ.

glTF = assets. USD = scenes-for-rendering. USDZ = Apple's locked variant. XRAI = the graph that references them all + adds agent-memory semantics.

One layer up. Not competing.

## 7 / governance

Year 1: BDFL (me).

Year 2+: transfer to Apache Software Foundation or W3C Community Group once we hit 1000+ external adopters. Never to a single-vendor foundation.

No corporate capture. Ever.

## 8 / honest gaps in v1.0

- Event primitives are a stub.
- Only 1 reference runtime shipped today (Unity + React Native).
- No validator CLI.

v1.1 addresses these. Shipping with known gaps on purpose — that's how you avoid the Xanadu death.

## 9 / how to help

1. File an issue describing a missing primitive.
2. Try authoring XRAI with Claude / GPT / Gemini — tell us where it breaks.
3. Star the repo. Share a scene you authored.

Reference runtime adapters (Three.js, PlayCanvas, Unreal, visionOS) land weeks 2–3.

## 10 / repo + spec

Repo: github.com/imclab/xra1
Spec: xrai.dev/SPEC.md
Manifesto: xrai.dev/MANIFESTO.md

"This Week in XRAI" weekly update, starts Friday.

## Alt openers (A/B variants to keep in reserve)

**A. Category-first:**
> Six years of AR startups, zero open standards for how AI agents describe 3D scenes. XRAI is the one I wish existed. Shipping it MIT today.

**B. Provocation:**
> If spatial AI ends up in walled gardens, it's because no one planted an open flag fast enough. This is mine.

**C. Founder angle (save for second post if thread underperforms):**
> I've built 3 spatial apps. Every time I hit the same wall: no shared language for AI agents to describe scenes. So I shipped one. MIT, forever.

## Do NOT

- Quote-tweet dunks on USDZ / Meta / OpenAI.
- Lead with Portals-the-company. Lead with XRAI.
- Promise features we don't have (validator CLI, visionOS runtime, multiplayer sync).
- Use "revolutionary", "game-changing", "the future of". Dry > hype.
